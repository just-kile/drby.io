How to calculate the ranking (12-months...)
===========================================

strength = avg. points / avg. points of median team

a) collect all games for the past 12 months
b) get the strength for this team for this month
	-> I need the ranking for this period
	-> If exists (official WFTDA ranking) => all good, nothing to do
	-> If it does not exist (unpublished) => Houston, we have a problem!
		- We need to fully calculate the ranking (start at a)
		- Seems to be an infinite loop?!?

==> e. g. calculate ranking for 2016-07-31


Alternatively: Do not calculate the full ranking but only differences
=====================================================================

Changes from 1 month => Next month

* Points from last month have to removed
* Points from month 6 (=> now 7) have a different decay factor
* Add points for the new games (=month 1)
	=> For all those, we need to calculate the game points
	=> If we need an unpublished ranking for any of these games, this won't be 100% accurate
	=> From the total game point score (can be calculated out of the ranking), add / subtract the point changed
* Recalculate weighted game points
	=> Easy
* With new total score & weighted game points, we have the new ranking!

Easiest calculation 
===================

* Just add the new games to the total points & recalculate average

==> Maybe we can calculate (or: better approximate) the points of Jul-Sep games points based of the ranking changes in Nov-Jan (decay factor for the games is changing!)
